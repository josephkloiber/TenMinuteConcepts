# Monte Carlo Versus Latin Square Sampling

## Introduction

Over the course of my career, I have observed many MS&A practitioners
use the phrase ``Monte Carlo'' without a true understanding of its intended 
application as a variance reduction technique as well as other methods of
variance reduction available.  This article demonstrates the advantages of 
an alternative method.

## The challenge
Estimate the value of $\pi$ using two different sampling methods:
+ Monte Carlo
+ Latin Square
